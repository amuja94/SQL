#In this project, I demonstrate my knowledge on updating and deleting data from a dataset

CREATE TABLE books (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
title TEXT,
author TEXT,
date_of_publication INTEGER,
number_of_pages INTEGER);

INSERT INTO books (title, author, date_of_publication, number_of_pages) 
    VALUES ("Swan's Way", "Marcel Proust", 1913, 512);
INSERT INTO books (title, author, date_of_publication, number_of_pages)
    VALUES ("The Prisoner", "Marcel Proust", 1923, 448); 
INSERT INTO books (title, author, date_of_publication, number_of_pages)
    VALUES ("The Grand Inquisitor", "Fyodor Dostoevsky", 1880, 46);
INSERT INTO books (title, author, date_of_publication, number_of_pages)
    VALUES ("The Possessed", "Fyodor Dostoevsky", 1872, 676);
INSERT INTO books (title, author, date_of_publication, number_of_pages)

#1. Demonstrate how to edit the data with incorrect spelling of the data:

UPDATE books SET title = "Swann's Way"
WHERE id = 1;

#2. Demonstrate how to remove data that does not belong in the dataset:

DELETE FROM books
WHERE title = "It Didn't Start With You";
