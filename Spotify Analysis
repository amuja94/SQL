#For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. I then created a table to insert Spotify data and performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#The Table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#I then inserted the Spotify data cvs. into the table
Next, I explored the data with the following SQL

#I wanted to get a quick overview of the information the database contains
SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#Then, I determined the top 10 songs by popularity
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity asc
LIMIT 10;

#I determined which artists song was the longest in duration
SELECT MAX(duration_ms) AS longest_song, track_name, artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms
LIMIT 1;

#Finally, I determined the average loudness, acousticness, instrumentalness and liveness by artist and track
SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(loudness), AVG(acousticness), AVG(instrumentalness), AVG(liveness)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;
