#How this can help a business:
By utilizing SQL to calculate various customer metrics such as total spending, purchase frequency, and average order value, I was able to understand the international customer base 
which allows the business to tailor marketing strategies, expand product offerings, and optimize customer service to better serve diverse customer demographics.
By focusing on a specific country like Brazil, the business can evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, identify trends in customer behavior, 
and potentially uncover opportunities for market expansion or localization efforts.

Identifying sales support agents allows the business to evaluate individual performance, allocate resources effectively, and provide targeted training or support
to improve sales effectiveness.

In addition, analyzing sales performance across different billing cities helps the business identify high-performing markets, allocate resources geographically, 
and tailor marketing efforts to local preferences and trends.

Lastly, knowing the top-selling track allows the business to understand customer preferences, optimize inventory management, and potentially negotiate better 
deals with suppliers for popular products.
