#By using SQL, I was able to analyze the data and determine that this company had a successful summer campaign. The company can utilize this information by using the same strategies
of their summer sale, and use that on all other sales. This would increase their yearly revenue.
In addition, the number one product is continuously their organic cotton sweater. It is obvious their customers appreciate the fabric, and the company can use this information to make 
more clothing made of the fabric, or provide more options for sweaters.
